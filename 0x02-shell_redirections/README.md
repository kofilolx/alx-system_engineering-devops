# Shell Scripting Basics

This project focuses on learning the fundamentals of shell scripting, I/O redirection, and working with special characters. By completing this project, you will be able to explain and apply the following concepts without relying on external resources:

## Learning Objectives

- Understand shell scripting and I/O redirection
- Explain the functionality of commands such as `head`, `tail`, `find`, `wc`, `sort`, `uniq`, `grep`, and `tr`
- Redirect standard output to a file
- Obtain standard input from a file instead of the keyboard
- Connect the output of one program to the input of another program
- Combine commands and filters with redirections
- Recognize and utilize special characters, including whitespace, single quotes, double quotes, backslash, comment, pipe, command separator, and tilde
- Comprehend and utilize the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files and their respective formats

## Copyright and Plagiarism

- Solutions for the tasks in this project must be independently created to fulfill the learning objectives.
- Plagiarism, including copying and pasting someone else's work, is strictly prohibited.
- Any content from this project should not be published or shared publicly.

## Requirements

- Editors allowed: vi, vim, emacs
- All scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Scripts must consist of exactly two lines (verified by `$ wc -l file` outputting 2)
- All files must end with a newline character
- The first line of all scripts must be `#!/bin/bash`
- Include a README.md file in the project's root folder that describes each script's purpose
- Avoid the use of backticks, `&&`, `||`, or `;` in your scripts
- All files must be executable
- The use of `sed` or `awk` is not allowed at this stage

## Additional Information

In addition to the mentioned learning objectives, you will also work with the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files, understanding their formats and contents.

Note: Concepts related to `fmt`, `pr`, `du`, `gzip`, `tar`, `lpr`, `sed`, and `awk` will not be covered in this project.

Keep in mind the above requirements and guidelines while working on the tasks of this project. Remember to execute your scripts on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and ensure that they meet the specified criteria.

Good luck!
