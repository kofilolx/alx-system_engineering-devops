# Regular Expressions - 0x06-regular_expressions

## Overview

This repository contains solutions for tasks related to regular expressions in the context of the "0x06-regular_expressions" project, part of the ALX School curriculum.

## Description

Regular expressions, often abbreviated as "regex" or "regexp", provide a powerful tool for searching, matching, and manipulating text based on patterns. In this project, we explore the fundamentals of regular expressions and their application in various scenarios.

## Contents

1. **0-simply_match_holberton.rb**: Ruby script that uses a regular expression to match the string "Holberton".

2. **1-repetition_token_0.rb**: Ruby script that matches specific repetitions of a token in a string.

3. **2-repetition_token_1.rb**: Ruby script that matches specific repetitions of a token in a string, with additional conditions.

4. **3-repetition_token_2.rb**: Ruby script that matches specific repetitions of a token in a string, with additional conditions.

5. **4-repetition_token_3.rb**: Ruby script that matches specific repetitions of a token in a string, with additional conditions.

6. **5-beginning_and_end.rb**: Ruby script that matches a string that starts with "h" and ends with "n", with any single character in between.

7. **6-phone_number.rb**: Ruby script that matches a 10-digit phone number.

8. **7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING.rb**: Ruby script that matches only uppercase letters in a string.

## Usage

To run the Ruby scripts, execute them in a Ruby environment. For example:

```bash
ruby 0-simply_match_holberton.rb
```
